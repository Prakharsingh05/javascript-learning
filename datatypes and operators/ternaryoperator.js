// ternay operator

let age= 15;
let drink ;

if(age>5){
    drink = "coffee";

}else{
    drink = "milk";
}

// the above written code is right but length this whole code can be compressed into a single line of cide using ternary operator
// ternary operator is  also +called condional operator

let age1 = 8;

let drink1 = age >=5 ? "coffee" : "milk"; // if true than coffee will be considered else milk
